Trust-opoly: An Interactive REIT & InvIT Financial Simulation
Trust-opoly is a strategic investment simulation built to educate users on the high-yield landscapes of Indian Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). Unlike traditional games, Trust-opoly integrates real-world financial data, SEBI regulations, and macroeconomic variables to simulate a professional fund management environment.

Project Vision
The project bridges the gap between theoretical finance and practical portfolio management. By gamifying the lifecycle of a unitholder, users learn to navigate interest rate cycles, regulatory shifts, and asset-specific risks.

Game Mechanics & Objectives
1. Starting Corpus & Growth
Initial Capital: Every player begins with an investment corpus of ₹100,000.

Objective: To maximize total Portfolio NAV (Net Asset Value) through strategic asset allocation and distribution harvesting.

2. Asset Acquisition & Management
REITs vs. InvITs: Players land on real listed Indian entities (e.g., Embassy Office Parks, Power Grid Infra, Nexus Select Trust).

Buy Logic: Acquire units at par value based on current market lot sizes.

Buy More (Scaling): Players can land on owned properties to "average up" or increase their stake, simulating a growing conviction in an asset.

Selling (Liquidity Premium): Players can liquidate units at any time they land on an owned asset for a 10% premium, simulating the bid-ask spreads and liquidity premiums of listed markets.

3. Earning Money: Distributions & Dividends
Passing GO: Every time a player completes a circuit of the board, they collect ₹15,000, representing the mandatory 90% NDCF (Net Distributable Cash Flow) distribution required by SEBI.

Quiz Rewards: Answering MCQ quizzes correctly rewards players with ₹5,000, reinforcing knowledge of SEBI regulations and trust structures.

Macroeconomic Simulation (The Chance Engine)
The core of the simulation is the Conditional Logic Chance System. Instead of generic events, the game simulates macroeconomic variables that only affect the player if they have the relevant market exposure:

RBI Interest Rate Cuts: Lowers debt costs; rewards players with REIT/InvIT holdings through special distributions.

Inflation Shocks: Increases operating costs; leads to distribution cuts for infrastructure assets (InvITs).

Tenant Dynamics: Simulates anchor tenant bankruptcies or new blue-chip lease signings (directly affecting REIT occupancy).

Traffic Forecasting: Simulates the volatility of toll-road InvITs versus the stability of annuity-based models.

If a player does not own the asset type mentioned on a Chance Card, the market event passes them by, teaching the importance of sector diversification.

Learning Concepts
Trust-opoly is built as an educational tool to master:

WALE (Weighted Average Lease Expiry): Understanding lease stability in commercial REITs.

NAV (Net Asset Value): Learning to value a portfolio based on underlying assets rather than just stock price.

Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM): Learning how government payments secure road InvIT income.

Regulatory Compliance: Realizing the impact of SEBI mandates on unitholder protection and distribution consistency.
